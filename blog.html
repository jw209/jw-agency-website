                <p>
                    Thank you for visiting my site! I feel its only appropriate to introduce myself for my first post.
                    At the time of writing this, I am finishing up my education in Real Estate with an upcoming sponsorship
                    from Berkshire Hathaway Home Services. I am excited to start my career in real estate and help people
                    find their dream homes in the northeast Ohio area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a young age, I always understood the important of having a place to call home. For many people,
                    owning a home is a significant milestone in their lives, and I understand that the entire process can be overwhelming.
                    Between my passion for helping others and my love for houses, architecture, and design I find myself to be deeply invested
                    in the entire process of buying and selling homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My passion for homes started when I bought my first home in 2023. The entire process of visiting homes, envisioning myself
                    and my wife living in them, and ultimately making an offer on a historical 1927 home in Canal Fulton, Ohio was an experience I will never forget.
                    For me, it was a combination of the surrounding area, the history, and the aesthetics of the home that made it special. I imagine that many
                    others choose their home for a diverse set of reasons, and I find that so fascinating. I honestly cannot wait to help others discover
                    what matters to them in a home and helping them find the perfect place to call their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But who am I and where does my expertise come from? Well, aside from my education in real estate, I have a background in software engineering.
                    I would like to think that this gives skills in problem solving, and attention to detail. I can apply this skill to help solve problems that
                    may arise during transactions by being logical, objective, and thorough throughout the entire process. Furthermore, with recently being
                    a part of a real estate transaction myself and then soon after attending real estate course, I was able to see the process from both sides.
                    I was able to recall things from my personal homebuying experience that resulted in negative outcomes. One example of this, was not signing
                    a buyer agency agreement with my agent. Since I wasn't aware that this was even a thing, and was not told about it, I was not able to take
                    full advantage of having an agent represent me and my interests. Pair the lack of agent representation with the hot sellers market, and the fact that
                    I was a first time homebuyer, and you can see how I would have been at a disadvantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this experience, I have determined that nobody should have to navigate a home sale or purchase without proper representation.
                    In a real-estate transaction, there are many moving parts and it can be easy to overlook important details. At the end of the day, the
                    seller wants to get a sale that they are happy with, and the buyer wants to buy a home that they are happy with without overpaying.
                    Through negotiations, you need a professional who knows the ins and outs of the process in order to ensure that both parties are satisfied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope that by sharing this experience, I can help others understand the importance of having an agent fully represent them. Its something
                    I wish I had known when I was buying my first home!
